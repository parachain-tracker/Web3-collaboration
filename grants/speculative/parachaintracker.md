# Parachaintracker

## Project Description
ParachainTracker is a curation site which provides a bird’s eye view to Polkadot and parachain projects. Think of it as the State-of-the-DApps dedicated to the Polkadot ecosystem, it will anyone to find projects building on the Substrate & nurture collaboration between teams who may not have met otherwise.  


This project is already being built with the help of Chris Hutchinson, Community Manager at W3F. We submitted several proposals on PolkaDAO to compensate the individuals who did the initial efforts of building ParachainTracker.  


We are people who believe decentralized world and are eager to build web3.0, and it is the reason why we do this.
